# 🔴 Day 1 – Blink & Button

This project is part of my **30-Day Robotics & IoT Simulation Challenge**.

## 🔧 Description
An LED is connected to pin 13 on the Arduino. A push button on pin 2 controls the blinking speed of the LED.  
- When the button is **not pressed**, the LED blinks slowly.  
- When the button is **pressed**, the LED blinks faster.

## 🧰 Tools & Components
- Arduino Uno (simulated in Tinkercad)
- 1 × LED
- 1 × 220Ω resistor
- 1 × Push button
- 1 × 10kΩ pull-down resistor

## 💻 Code
See `BlinkButton.ino` for the complete code.
